# Gazebo Simulator , RVIZ

Industrial robots are the most widely made and utilized robots in the manufacturing industry. In automotive material handling and general industrial applications, the pick and place robots is developed for maximum flexibility, efficiency, and durability. Now a day a variety, if technologies are employed to aid in the advancement and progress of robotic activities such as simulation modelling and analysis of robots, the first objective of our project, is to implement a pick and place robot that helps us to pick the objects and place it on the required position here we have implemented this robot in gazebo using the Rviz and python and c-Make.
